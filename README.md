# Loan Status Prediction 💳🏦

This project focuses on predicting the approval status of loan applications using machine learning classification models. Loan prediction systems help financial institutions  reduce risk.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
- Build a classification model to predict whether a loan application will be **The applicant defaulted** or **The loan was repaid successfully**.
- Use applicant demographic, financial, and credit-related features.
- Apply data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.
- Deploy the model for interactive use.

## 🗂 Dataset
- Source: Public loan prediction datasets (e.g., [Kaggle - Loan Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ninzaami/loan-prediction)).
- Features:
  - **Applicant Income**
  - **Loan Amount**
  - **Loan Amount Term**
  - **Credit History**
  - **Gender, Marital Status, Dependents**
  - **Education, Employment Status**
  - **Property Area**
  - **Loan Status** (target variable: The loan was repaid successfully/The applicant defaulted)

## ⚙️ Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   - Handle missing values  
   - Encode categorical variables  
   - Scale numerical features
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualize distributions and correlations  
   - Identify key drivers of loan approval
3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Create derived features (e.g., income-to-loan ratio)  
   - Handle imbalanced classes
4. **Modeling**  
   - Logistic Regression  
   - Decision Tree / Random Forest  
   - XGBoost / Gradient Boosting  
   - Neural Networks (optional)
5. **Evaluation**  
   Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC
